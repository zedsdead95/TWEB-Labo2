## Implementation

### This project was created by John Arhur and modified by Walid Koubaa to fit the purpose of listing Github issues.

The original objective of this project was to write a todo list app that utilized `@kadira/storybook` (aka `react-storybook`) with tests utilizing `jest`. Starting from a [TodoMVC Template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template), css considerations were taken care of. With a demo project like this, `react-scripts` seemed a convenient way to abstract away most of the boilerplate heavy configuration typical in a react project from the committed-codebase for purposes of brevity, with the added bonus of using `jest` under-the-hood for testing by default.
